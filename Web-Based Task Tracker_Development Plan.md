**Development Plan \- Web-Based Task Tracker**

**1\. Introduction**  
1.1. **Purpose:** This document outlines the plan for developing the Web-Based Task Tracker, including phases, milestones, resource allocation (conceptual), and timeline estimates.  
1.2. **Scope:** Covers the development lifecycle from initial setup to deployment, based on the SRS and HLD. All features discussed are considered in scope for the initial release.

**2\. Development Methodology**  
2.1. **Agile (Scrum-like):** An Agile approach, incorporating elements of Scrum, is recommended.  
\* **Sprints:** Development will be broken down into short iterations (e.g., 2-week sprints).  
\* **Sprint Planning:** Define achievable goals for each sprint.  
\* **Daily Stand-ups:** Brief daily meetings to discuss progress, blockers.  
\* **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate completed work at the end of each sprint.  
\* **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement.  
2.2. **Prioritization:** While all features are critical for the initial release, tasks within sprints will be prioritized to ensure foundational elements are built first.

**3\. Development Phases & Milestones**

     \*\*Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Sprint 0-1) \- Estimated: 2-3 Weeks\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Tasks:\*\*

**4\. Resource Allocation (Conceptual)**  
\* **Development Team:**  
\* 1-2 Backend Developer(s)  
\* 1-2 Frontend Developer(s)  
\* (Alternatively, 2-3 Full-Stack Developers)  
\* **QA/Tester:** 1 (can be part-time or a developer taking on testing responsibilities in smaller teams)  
\* **Project Manager/Product Owner (Media Manager or representative):** To provide requirements, feedback, and prioritize.  
\* **UI/UX Designer:** (Potentially part-time or upfront for initial designs)

**5\. Timeline Estimate (Rough)**  
\* Total Estimated Development Sprints: 11 Sprints  
\* Assuming 2-week sprints: 11 \* 2 \= 22 weeks.  
\* Total Estimated Time: Approximately **5-7 months**, depending on team size, complexity encountered, and efficiency. This includes design, development, testing, and initial deployment.  
\* This estimate is aggressive given all features are "critical" and assumes a focused, experienced team. Buffer for unforeseen issues or scope adjustments is advisable.

**6\. Tools & Technologies (Summary from HLD)**  
\* **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab)  
\* **Project Management:** Jira, Trello, Asana (or similar Agile tool)  
\* **Communication:** Slack, Microsoft Teams  
\* **Frontend:** React/Vue.js/Angular  
\* **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express/NestJS)  
\* **Database:** PostgreSQL  
\* **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions  
\* **Testing Frameworks:** (Jest/Mocha for JS, PyTest for Python, Cypress/Selenium for E2E)

**7\. Risks & Mitigation**  
\* **Risk: Scope Creep.**  
\* Mitigation: Strict adherence to defined requirements for the initial release. New features to be logged for future iterations.  
\* **Risk: Underestimated Complexity (especially for calendar, notifications).**  
\* Mitigation: Allocate sufficient time for these features. Break them into smaller, manageable tasks. Early prototyping.  
\* **Risk: Team Member Availability/Changes.**  
\* Mitigation: Ensure good knowledge sharing and documentation. Cross-train if possible.  
\* **Risk: Integration Issues (if any external APIs were to be added later).**  
\* Mitigation: N/A for current scope as external system integration is out of scope.  
\* **Risk: Performance issues with large data sets on calendar.**  
\* Mitigation: Optimize queries and data loading for the calendar. Implement pagination or lazy loading if necessary.
