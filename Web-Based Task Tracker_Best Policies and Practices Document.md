**3\. Best Policies and Practices Document \- Web-Based Task Tracker**

**1\. Introduction**  
1.1. **Purpose:** This document outlines the recommended policies and best practices for the development, deployment, maintenance, and usage of the Web-Based Task Tracker. Adherence to these guidelines will promote code quality, system stability, security, and maintainability.  
1.2. **Scope:** Covers coding standards, development workflow, testing, security, data management, and user conduct.

**2\. Development Practices**

     2.1. \*\*Version Control (Git)\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* All code and configuration files must be stored in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Use feature branches for all new development and bug fixes (e.g., \`feature/FR12-notifications\`, \`bugfix/calendar-display-issue\`).  
        \*   Commit frequently with clear, concise commit messages.  
        \*   Conduct code reviews (Pull Requests / Merge Requests) before merging into the main development branch (e.g., \`develop\` or \`main\`).  
        \*   Protect main branches (\`main\`/\`master\`, \`develop\`) from direct pushes.  
        \*   Use tags for releases (e.g., \`v1.0.0\`, \`v1.0.1\`).

2.2. \*\*Coding Standards\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Adhere to established coding standards and style guides for the chosen programming languages and frameworks.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   \*\*Readability:\*\* Write clean, self-documenting code. Use meaningful variable and function names.  
        \*   \*\*Modularity:\*\* Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions/modules/components.  
        \*   \*\*DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):\*\* Avoid code duplication.  
        \*   \*\*Comments:\*\* Add comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or public APIs.  
        \*   \*\*Linters & Formatters:\*\* Utilize tools like ESLint/Prettier (JavaScript), Flake8/Black (Python) to enforce style and catch errors early. Integrate these into the development workflow (e.g., pre-commit hooks).

2.3. \*\*Testing\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Implement a comprehensive testing strategy covering different levels.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   \*\*Unit Tests:\*\* For individual functions, modules, and components. Aim for high code coverage.  
        \*   \*\*Integration Tests:\*\* To test interactions between different components/services (e.g., API endpoint with database).  
        \*   \*\*End-to-End (E2E) Tests:\*\* To simulate user workflows through the UI (e.g., using Cypress, Selenium).  
        \*   \*\*Automated Testing:\*\* Integrate tests into a CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on every commit/PR.  
        \*   \*\*Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):\*\* Consider adopting where appropriate.

2.4. \*\*Dependency Management\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Carefully manage external libraries and dependencies.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm/yarn for Node.js, pip/Poetry for Python).  
        \*   Pin dependency versions to ensure reproducible builds.  
        \*   Regularly review and update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities and get bug fixes. Use tools like \`npm audit\` or \`safety\` (Python).

2.5. \*\*Configuration Management\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Separate configuration from code. Never commit sensitive credentials or secrets directly into the codebase.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Use environment variables for configuration settings (database URLs, API keys, secret keys).  
        \*   Provide template configuration files (e.g., \`.env.example\`) in the repository.  
        \*   Use a secrets management solution for production (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables provided by PaaS).  
   

**3\. Security Practices**

     3.1. \*\*Input Validation\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Validate all user inputs on both the client-side (for quick feedback) and server-side (as the authoritative source of truth).  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS. Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.

3.2. \*\*Authentication & Authorization\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Implement strong authentication and fine-grained authorization.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Store passwords securely (hashed and salted, e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).  
        \*   Use secure session management (e.g., JWTs with short expiry, HTTPS-only cookies).  
        \*   Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) diligently on all API endpoints.

3.3. \*\*HTTPS\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* All communication between the client and server must be over HTTPS.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Configure web servers to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Use valid SSL/TLS certificates.

3.4. \*\*Security Headers\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Implement appropriate HTTP security headers.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Use headers like \`Content-Security-Policy\` (CSP), \`X-Content-Type-Options\`, \`X-Frame-Options\`, \`Strict-Transport-Security\` (HSTS).

3.5. \*\*Regular Security Audits\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Conduct periodic security reviews or penetration testing, especially before major releases or if handling highly sensitive data.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Utilize automated security scanning tools.

**4\. Data Management Practices**

     4.1. \*\*Data Backup & Recovery\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Implement a regular, automated backup schedule for the database.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).  
        \*   Store backups securely and, if possible, in a separate geographical location.  
        \*   Periodically test the restore process.

4.2. \*\*Data Privacy\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Handle user data responsibly and in accordance with any applicable privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Collect only necessary personal data. Be transparent about data usage.

**5\. Deployment Practices**

     5.1. \*\*CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Automate the build, test, and deployment process.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions. Deploy to staging first, then production after successful validation.

5.2. \*\*Environment Parity\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to ensure consistency.

5.3. \*\*Monitoring & Logging\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\*  
        \*   Log important application events, errors, and user actions.  
        \*   Monitor application performance (response times, error rates, resource usage).  
        \*   Set up alerts for critical issues.  
        \*   Use tools like Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana, or cloud provider monitoring services.

**6\. User Policies (for Application Users)**

     6.1. \*\*Password Security\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Users must create strong, unique passwords.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Enforce password complexity rules. Advise against sharing credentials.

6.2. \*\*Data Entry Accuracy\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* Users are responsible for the accuracy of the data they input into the system.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* Media Analysts should double-check spot counts. Media Managers should verify information before client submission.

6.3. \*\*Appropriate Use\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Policy:\*\* The system should be used only for its intended business purpose.  
    \*   \*\*Practice:\*\* No unauthorized access attempts or misuse of messaging features.
