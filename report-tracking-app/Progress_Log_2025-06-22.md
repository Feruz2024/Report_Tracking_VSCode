# Progress Log - June 22, 2025

## Major Actions
- Fully reset the Django/React project to match the last successful remote commit.
- Dropped all tables in the PostgreSQL database to ensure a clean schema.
- Reapplied all Django migrations to rebuild the schema from scratch.
- Created initial user groups: Admins, Managers, Analysts, Accountants.
- Created initial users and assigned them to the correct groups:
  - admin (superuser, Admins)
  - MihretChuni, MihretDesalegn, BethelhemGirma (Analysts)
  - SelamAhmed (Managers)
- Verified and fixed group name mismatches in both the database and backend logic.
- Verified and fixed NOT NULL constraint errors in the Assignment model by adding missing BooleanFields and recreating migrations.
- Implemented and ran a custom Django management command to automate group and user creation.
- Verified that the `/api/auth/token/` endpoint works for login and token authentication.
- Confirmed frontend login flow is working and displays error messages as expected.

- Enhanced notification system:
  - Notification click navigation (popups/tabs for all entity types, messages, assignments, etc.)
  - Backend notification triggers for assignments, campaigns, and groundwork for all scenarios
  - Added support for notification links and deadlines
  - Laid groundwork for configurable lead times and user settings
  - (Frontend/Backend) Ready for user-configurable notification lead times and reminder scheduling
